## For Visiting students & PhD applicants
#### PhD Admission at HKU Business School
I regularly receive emails soliciting my interest in hiring PhD students, but this is unnecessary. In my current institution, PhD admission decisions in our area are committee-based. However, if you are already a doctoral student interested in ESG and institutional analysis from a different institution, there might be a visiting opportunity. 

#### My style as a PhD adviser
* My goal is to help you become an independent and productive scholar.
* I am not a micro-manager. However, if you believe that a healthy dose of structure with reminders and deadlines is helpful for you, please ask for it from me explicitly. 
* I respcet your boundaries and understand that you have multiple priorities in life. I don't think research is the most important thing in life. It is unlikely that you will receive a message from me on holidays and weekends.
* In general, I am responsive. In return, I also expect you to be responsive. 
* You don't have to agree with me all the time, but you should provide a well-reasoned explanation. This principle applies to responding to reviewers.
* I am on your side when you need support. That means I am with you even if you decide that research is not your cup of tea. However, you should take the initiative to communicate your concerns in a timely manner. 

#### My intellectual style
As a management scholar, I care about theoretical novelty, empirical rigor, and practical relevance. A good paper should at least have two or more of the elements.

#### Why PhD in Management?
1. You will NOT become a CEO of a large multinational firm after doing a PhD in management. On the contrary, doing this will most likely kill your chance to be a CEO. An imperfect but useful analogy is that a management scholar is to a manager as a football game analyst is to a footballer.

 

2. Management research treats managerial phenomena as if they can be scientifically analyzed and generalized and develop abstract theories to describe complex managerial issues in simple ways. Sometimes certain scholars go too far in developing theories on phenomena that few people care about. Sometimes certain scholars are not careful in developing explanations that are logically coherent and scientifically rigorous. Management research must balance between academic rigor and practical relevance. 

 

3. As a management scholar, you will have the opportunity to help train and educate the next generation of corporate leaders. Future and current managers love to go back to business schools to reflect on their past experiences and learn from your research if it is interesting and relevant.
